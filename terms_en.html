By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you — you must make sure to read them carefully before using the app. You are not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks. You are not allowed to attempt to extract the app's source code, nor should you try to translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions. The app itself, along with all trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights associated with it, belong to the company Asendi. <br><br>The company Asendi is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For this reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear exactly what you are paying for. <br><br>The Asendi app stores and processes the personal data you have provided us, in order to operate the service. It is your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by your device's official operating system. Doing so could make your phone vulnerable to malware, viruses, malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features, and mean the app may not work properly or at all. <br><br>The app may use third-party services, if necessary, which declare their own terms and conditions. <br><br>The terms and conditions of the third-party service providers used by the app are associated with these owners. <br><br>You should be aware that there are certain things for which the company Asendi will not take responsibility. Certain functions of the app require an active Internet connection. This connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but the company Asendi cannot take responsibility if the app does not work fully if you do not have access to Wi-Fi or have no active mobile data. <br><br>If you use the app outside a Wi-Fi-covered area, remember that the terms of your mobile network provider agreement still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for data costs during the duration of the connection when accessing the app, as well as any third-party fees. By using the app, you accept responsibility for these charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside your home territory (i.e., region or country) without turning off data roaming. <br><br>Similarly, the company Asendi cannot always take responsibility for how you use the app, meaning you need to ensure your device stays charged. If it runs out of battery and you cannot turn it on to use the service, the company Asendi cannot accept responsibility. <br><br>Regarding the company Asendi's responsibility for your use of the app, when you use the app, it is important to keep in mind that while we strive to ensure it is updated and correct at all times, we rely on third parties to provide information so that we can make it available. The company Asendi accepts no liability for any direct or indirect loss you experience due to fully understanding this functionality of the app. <br><br>At some point, we may want to update the app. The app is currently available on Android - the requirements for the system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the app's availability to) may change, and you will need to download updates if you wish to continue using the app. The company Asendi does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the app when offered, and we may also wish to stop providing the app and may terminate use at any time without giving you prior notice of termination. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these Terms will end; and (b) You must stop using the app and (if needed) delete it from your device. <br><br>Changes to these terms and conditions: <br><br>I may update our terms and conditions from time to time. Therefore, it is advisable to review this page periodically for any changes. I will inform you of any changes by posting the new terms and conditions on this page. <br><br>These terms and conditions are effective as of 10-10-2024.
